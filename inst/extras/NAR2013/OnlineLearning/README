# Compare classification performance of the methods
#main.R  # deeper convergence (more trees, more genes) but slow; no size limit for a class
main2.R # brief overview with lighter model optimization and multiple class min sizes
main2ENSG.R # brief overview with lighter model optimization and multiple class min sizes
