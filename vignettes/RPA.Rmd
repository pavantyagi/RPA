# Robust Probabilistic Averaging (RPA)

[Robust Probabilistic Averaging
(RPA)](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/RPA.html) is
a fully scalable algorithm for probe-level preprocessing and analysis
of short oligonucleotide microarray collections of any size, from
moderately sized standard data sets to arbitrarily large microarray
atlases involving tens of thousands of samples, or more.

Special wrappers are available for Affymetrix gene expression arrays
and phylogenetic micoarrays (HITChip).

RPA also provides explicit data-driven estimates of probe-specific
affinity and noise based on a rigorous probabilistic model and
significantly outperforms the standard RMA model in benchmarking tests
([NAR 2013](http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/41/10/e110)), at the
same time achieving a full scalability.


## How to use

The method is available in
[R/Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/RPA.html),
and documented in the publications listed below. For all installation
and usage instructions, kindly see the [RPA
wiki](https://github.com/antagomir/RPA/wiki).
